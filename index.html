        <h2>ABOUT MDVI- PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE DISABILITIES </h2>
        <p>When a person has several different disabilities, he/she is said to have a condition called Multiple
          Disabilities. For example, the person may have difficulties in learning, along with controlling movements
          and/or with hearing and vision. The effect of multiple disabilities can be more than the combination of two
          individual disabilities. Often, people may not know how much a multiple disabled person maybe comprehending,
          and his/her attempts to communicate may be unfamiliar to us and may pass unnoticed. For these reasons they may
          be wrongly labelled as having intellectual disorders, which is not the case.</p><br>

        <h2>SOME EXAMPLES OF MULTIPLE DISABILITIES ARE:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Deaf blind (Visual Impairment + Hearing Impairment)</li>
          <li>Visual Impairment + Hearing Impairment + Mental Retardation</li>
          <li>Visual Impairment + Mental Retardation</li>
